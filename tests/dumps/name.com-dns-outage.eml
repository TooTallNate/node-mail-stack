Subject: npmjs.org site auto-renewal, DNS records deleted. What's going on?
From: Isaac Schlueter <i@izs.me>
To: support@name.com

My domains npmjs.com and npmjs.org were set to auto-renew.  Their
expiration date was last night, 2011-03-19.

It looks like they are still in my account, but all the DNS records
were deleted, and they are resolving to a parking page.  When I click
"renew", nothing happens (likely because they are already
auto-renewed?)

Please explain to me how you believe that this is appropriate behavior
on your part as a domain name service.  I set up automatic billing and
automatic renewal precisely so that this *wouldn't* happen, and there
is no indication in your documentation that DNS records will be
deleted as part of the automatic renewal process.

This has caused a major disruption in the applications of mine that
use these websites to communicate.  It is completely unacceptable
behavior, and makes name.com look like you don't know what you're
doing.  If you can't keep my DNS records and domain registry
information up to date, then what am I paying you for?

Please explain how this happened, and the specific steps you are
taking to make sure that it never happens again.
